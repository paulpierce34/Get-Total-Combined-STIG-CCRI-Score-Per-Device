# Get-Total-Combined-STIG-CCRI-Score-Per-Device
This script is used to calculate the total CCRI STIG score per device, from STIG checklist (.ckl) files in a directory. For example, if you have numerous devices with numerous STIGs applied to each of them in the given directory, the script will combine all the scores per device and then calculate the CCRI score (out of 100%) per device.
